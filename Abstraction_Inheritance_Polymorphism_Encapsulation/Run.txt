Step 1: Create a New Project

    Open Visual Studio.
    Click on "Create a new project."
    Select the type of project you want (Console Application, Windows Forms App, etc.).
    Choose a template and configure your project settings.
    Click "Create" to create the project.

Step 2: Add New C# Files

    Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer.
    Select "Add" and then choose "New Item..."
    Choose "Class" or "Code File" from the list.
    Give the new file a name and click "Add."

Repeat these steps to add as many C# files as you need to your project.
Step 3: Write Code in Each File

Open each file and write your C# code. Make sure to use appropriate namespaces and class structures to organize your code.
Step 4: Set the Entry Point

If you have multiple files with Main methods, Visual Studio needs to know which one to use as the entry point. To set the entry point:

    Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer.
    Select "Properties."
    Go to the "Application" tab.
    Set the "Startup object" to the class containing your Main method.

Step 5: Build and Run

    Press Ctrl + Shift + B or go to "Build" > "Build Solution" to build your project.
    Press F5 or go to "Debug" > "Start Debugging" to run your application.
