Running a command-line arguments program in Visual Studio involves configuring the project to accept command-line arguments and then providing them through the project settings. Here are the steps:

    Open or Create a Console Application:
        Open Visual Studio.
        Create a new Console Application project or open an existing one.

    Configure Command-Line Arguments in Project Settings:

        Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.

        Select "Properties."

        In the project properties window, go to the "Debug" tab.

        In the "Start Options" section, you'll find a field named "Command line arguments." Enter your command-line arguments here, separated by spaces.
